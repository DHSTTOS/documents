1)
the line-chart should show
one line for number of TCP connections,
one line for ... UDP
... IP
... ether
... profinet
and only those lines for which the global filters are "on"/true should be shown

2) the diagram's legend for the x-axis should not overlap the brush area
3) fix the legend for the colors (e.g currently it shows "profinet" & "ip"; should be "profinet" & "ether"
4) ticktexts on the x-axis shouldn't overlap
5) the uppermost ticktext on the y-axis is missing/invisible

6) when creating a new diagram, the global filters should be set to a reasonable/usable
state for that diagram (probably "on" for all)
