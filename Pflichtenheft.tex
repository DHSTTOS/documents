\section{Purpose}\label{sec:intro}
The goal of this project is to create a software visualization tool for industrial network traffic to simplify the analysis of anomalous behaviour, both in realtime and from captured stored data.
\newline
\newline
This software is part of the ADIN framework and is referered to as the "ADIN Inspector".
\\
One component to achieve this goal is a web interface built with modularity in mind so as to make it easily extendable.
\newline
\newline
The Web view is able to display a series of diagrams and charts to easily identify the behaviour of the network.
Within the Web view the user has the ability to zoom, select, highlight, and filter out data to better understand the aforementioned behaviour in different OSI layers, as well as visualize the flow rate between network nodes.
\newline
\newline
To support this Web view a back-end messaging solution is needed. This allows the user to easily switch between multiple streams of captured data.
\\
\section{Overall Description}
%%Visual Analytics is utilizing graphics to enhance human cognition to understand a problem better or find 'a needle in the haystack' within a huge amount of data. Industrial Network Security aims to understand the communication network traffic generated in an  industrial production system. Analyzing the traffic generated by underlying industrial protocols is the primary step. Real-time visualization of analyzed network data will help the end-user to understand the system's communication behavior and changes within it more clearly. Deviations or incidents can be detected visually as they are occurring or already persisting.

While computers can analyze raw data easily, for humans it's easier to recognize behavior using visual aids.
Visual analytics is utilizing graphics to enhance human cognition to understand a problem better or find 'a needle in the haystack' within a huge amount of data. Making it an invaluable tool for security analysis.

Real-time visualization of analyzed network data will help the end-user to understand the system's communication behavior and changes within it more clearly. Deviations or incidents can be detected visually by operators as they are occurring or already persisting.\newline
\newline
Supplemental to this, the ability of operators to run an analysis of past anomalous behavior can help strengthen infrastructure for future failure or attacks. As well as provide useful information for training of new security analysts.

\section{Software Modeling}



\subsection{GUI}
%%The basic data structure needed for graphs are a given set of nodes and a given set of edges, as they are often drawn
%%as node-link diagrams. In the postal data set, nodes could represent the origins and destinations of postal flows. Edges represent the flows between the respective origins and destinations.In intelligence analysis, investigators use semantic graphs to organize concepts and relationships as
%%graph nodes and links in hopes of discovering key trends, patterns, and insights.”

%%A key issue in graph visualization is the size of the graph, i.e. the size of the data to visualize. With a growing amount of data to display, graphs can become too complex and overburdening for the analyst's cognitive capacity. It thus becomes difficult for the user to conduct significant analysis. Because of the issues described above, research often focuses on ways to solve the problems of visual clutter, e.g. by aggregation or clustering techniques, which is also one of the main topics of cartographic generalization.

%%For example, Cui et al. (2008) investigate node-link diagrams for network visualisation.
%Their study focuses on the problem of visual cluttering in graph visualisations,
%as this is one of the main issues in the representation of relationships among
%large data (Herman, Melancon, and Marshall, 2000). They introduce a framework
%for geometry-based edge clustering to group edges into bundles and hence reduce
%visual cluttering caused by the crossing of the high number of edges (see figure 2.1).

\\
In this subsection we'll discuss the GUI, it's components and the workflow of a typical user.
\\
As the programm is opened the user is greeted with a login screen shown in \autoref{fig:loginWindow}. After the user has entered it's credentials and clicked on the login button he is shown \autoref{fig:mainWindow0}.
\\
\vfill

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/01MWL.png}
	\caption{The Login Windows shown as the page is first loaded}
	\label{fig:loginWindow}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[ht]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/02MW.png}
	\caption{The Main window the user sees once he logs in}
	\label{fig:mainWindow0}
\end{figure}
\vfill
\clearpage

To discuss in depth this interface it has been divided into subsections labeled in \autoref{fig:mainWindow5}, these are:
\\
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Data stream drop down menu allows the user to select which stream he is currently listening to. This dropdown menu shows the selected diagram's selected data stream and by default is set to real-time.
\item Here the user can set filters affecting all diagrams, namely limiting which layers and protocols are currently being shown.
\item Here are the filters that can further restrict the data being shown in the selected diagram.
\item By clicking this button the user can create a new diagram shown in number 5. The creation workflow is shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow1} to \autoref{fig:mainWindow5}.
\item Here is the currently logged in user, by clicking the button to the right of his name the user can log out.
\item This is the diagrams container, inside are all diagrams the user has created with all the set constraints. At most 4 diagrams are shown on the container, and more can be made visible via the slider on the right of the container.
\item This is a diagram.
\item By hovering with the mouse over a data point a tooltip is shown with all data associated with this data point.
\item These buttons control whether a diagram is fullscreen and the diagram settings. By clicking the button labeled F the diagram grows to take on all available space on the container, like shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow0}.
\\
Clicking on the button labeled "S" replaces the diagram with the Settings for this diagram like shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow1}
\item The play button auto scroll along the selected time frame
\item This timeline shows on the left and right bottom labels the beginning and end of all data streams, the labels on top show the currently selected time window and are movable to increase,decrease the time window, the middle shield icon shows the current time while being played, and is also movable to scroll by data manually. (TBD)

\end{enumerate}


\vfill

\begin{figure}[ht]

	\label{fig:mainWindow5}
\end{figure}

\vfill
\clearpage

Next we'll take a look at the workflow a user will go through when opening a new diagram.
\\
As referenced above \autoref{fig:mainWindow0} is what the user first sees. When he wants to create a new diagram, by clicking the button labeled new diagram, the Main window is split (shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow1}) and the new diagram settings are shwon where the new diagram will be.
\\
The user sets here the settings for the new diagram, these are: 
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item{Which data stream it draws its data from}
\item{Which data is pulled to be represented as the x and y axis}
\item{Any filters the user wants to apply at the start}
\end{itemize}

Afterwards, the screen looks like \autoref{fig:mainWindow2}, the diagram container split, by going through this process two more times the diagram container fills up, containing four diagrams total (shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow3}), at this point the diagrams have their minimum size.
\\
Any diagrams created afterwards are spawned underneath the existing ones and the user can scroll up and down to view all of them (shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow4}) (TBD)

\subsubsection{Interactivity}

Visual analytics methods combine interactive visualisations with automated analysis
techniques. This allows the user to decide e.g. which part
of the data he or she wants to explore in more detail.

 A basic principle for visual data exploration was introduced by Shneiderman (1997) by what he called the “The Visual Information Seeking Mantra: 

Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-ondemand”.
This lets the data analyst define to a certain level what he or she wants
to see and visualise. 

Similar to this, Bertin (1983) specified three “levels of reading,”:
The elementary level (allowing the analyst to look at the information about a
single data record), the intermediate level (showing summarised information about a group of data records), and the global level (providing an overview of all data elements).
