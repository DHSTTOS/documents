Format of input data:
Do all data streams that we will have to display consist of JSON objects?
Does each object have a time stamp?

Or will there be data streams with a constant sampling rate? If so, how and where is the start time and sampling rate of such a stream specified?

Do the dissectors all produce data with the same format or different formats?
If it's different formats: do they contain an id field?
e.g. :{"id": "dissector_format_one", "sender": "127.0.0.1" }, {"id": "dissector_format_two", "time": "07:00:00.01"}


Do the dissector formats contain fields with named values, e.g. a field "alarm level" with the possible values "high", "medium", "low"?
If so, is this specified somewhere, e.g. in a JSON Schema?
Or should our program go through the whole data stream to collect all possible values?

Do the dissector formats contain fields with numerical values that are limited to a certain range?
(e.g. a "alarm priority" with a range of 1-100)
If so, is the range specified somewhere, e.g. in a JSON Schema?
Or should our program go through the whole data stream to determine the maximum and minimum values and scale the diagram axes accordingly?


Is each JSON object saved in the MongoDB as a single document? Or are multiple objects grouped together? Or some other format?


Display:
Is it required that data from more than one dissector can be displayed in one diagram at the same time? (e.g. a line diagram with data from dissector_one in red and data from dissector_two in blue)

Is it required that data from different time ranges of one data stream can be displayed together in one diagram? (e.g. a diagram with time from 00:00 to 23:59 on the x-axis, with monday's data in blue and tuesday's data in red)
