\section{Motivation}\label{sec:intro}
The goal of this project is to create a software visualization tool for industrial network traffic to simplify the analysis of anomalous behaviour, both in realtime and from stored captured data.
\newline
\newline
This software is part of the Anomaly Detection in Industrial Networks (ADIN) framework and is referred to as the "ADIN Inspector". The ADIN framework serves to first capture network traffic in industrial networks. This traffic data is then dissect and analyzed for anomalies using machine learning. A streaming platform is used to provide access to both network data and the notifications produced by the dissectors. Finally, a GUI component visualizes the network traffic and anomalies.
\\
One component to achieve this goal is a web interface built with modularity in mind so as to make it easily extendable.
\newline
\newline
The Web view is able to display a series of \glspl{diagram} and charts to easily identify the behaviour of the network.
Within the Web view the user has the ability to zoom, select, highlight, and filter out data to better understand the aforementioned behaviour at different OSI layers, as well as visualize the flow rate between network nodes.
\newline
\newline
To support this Web view a back-end messaging solution is needed. This allows the user to easily switch between multiple streams of captured data.
\\
\section{Overview}

While computers can analyze raw data easily, for humans it's easier to recognize behavior using visual aids.
Visual analytics is utilizing graphics to enhance human cognition to understand a problem better or find 'a needle in the haystack' within a huge amount of data. Making it an invaluable tool for security analysis.
\newline
\newline
Industrial network security aims to understand the communication network traffic generated in an industrial production system. Analyzing the traffic generated by underlying industrial protocols is the primary step.
\newline
\newline
Real-time visualization of analyzed network data will help the end-user to understand the system's communication behavior and changes within it more clearly. Deviations or incidents can be detected visually by operators as they are occurring or already persisting.\newline
\newline
Supplemental to this, the ability of operators to run an analysis of past anomalous behavior can help strengthen infrastructure for future failure or attacks. As well as provide useful information for training of new security analysts.

\section{Software Modeling}



\subsection{GUI}
In this subsection we'll discuss the GUI, it's components and the workflow of a typical user.
\subsubsection{Main Window}
As the programm is opened the user is greeted with a login screen shown in \autoref{fig:loginWindow}. After the user has entered it's credentials and clicked on the login button he is shown \autoref{fig:mainWindow0}.
\\

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/01MWL.png}
	\caption{The Login Windows shown as the page is first loaded}
	\label{fig:loginWindow}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/02MW.png}
	\caption{The Main window the user sees once he logs in}
	\label{fig:mainWindow0}
\end{figure}
\vfill
\clearpage

To discuss in depth this interface it has been divided into subsections labeled in \autoref{fig:mainWindow5}, these are:
\\
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The Data stream drop down menu allows the user to select which stream he is currently listening to. This dropdown menu shows the selected diagram's selected data stream and by default is set to real-time.
	\item Here the user can set filters affecting all diagrams, namely limiting which layers and protocols are currently being shown. To add a new filter a user would click on the add filter button, select which part of the data stream is to be used in the filter, any optional comparators, and set a parameter in the text-box.
	\item This button opens the diagram filter list. This list contains filters specific to each diagram.
	\item By clicking this button the user can create a new diagram. The creation workflow is shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow1} to \autoref{fig:mainWindow5}.
	\item Here is the currently logged in user, by clicking the button to the right of his name the user can log out.
	\item This is the \gls{diagram container}, inside are all diagrams the user has created with all the set constraints. At most 4 diagrams are shown in the container, and more can be made visible via the slider on the right of the container.
	\item This is a diagram.
	\item By hovering with the mouse over a data point a tooltip is shown with all data associated with this data point.
	\item These buttons control whether a diagram is fullscreen and the diagram settings. By clicking the button labeled F the diagram grows to take on all available space in the container, like shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow0}.
	      \\
	      Clicking on the button labeled "S" replaces the diagram with the Settings for this diagram like shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow1}
	\item The play button starts and stops auto scroll along the selected time frame
	\item This is a timeline represented as a slider. It shows on the left and right bottom labels the beginning and end of all data streams.
\\ The labels on top show the currently selected time window and are movable to increasea nd decrease the time window.
\\ The middle shield icon shows the current time while being played, and is also movable to scroll by data manually.

Next we'll take a look at the workflow a user will go through when opening a new diagram.
\\
As referenced above \autoref{fig:mainWindow0} is what the user first sees. When he wants to create a new diagram, by clicking the button labeled new diagram, the Main window is split (shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow1}) and the new diagram settings are shwon where the new diagram will be.
\\
The user sets here the settings for the new diagram, these are:
\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Which data stream it draws its data from}
	\item{Which data is pulled to be represented as the x and y axis}
	\item{Any filters the user wants to apply at the start}
\end{itemize}

Afterwards, the screen looks like \autoref{fig:mainWindow2}, the \gls{diagram container} split in half. By going through this process two more times the diagram container fills up, containing four diagrams total (shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow3}); at this point the diagrams have their minimum size.
\\
Any diagrams created afterwards are spawned underneath the existing ones and the user can scroll up and down to view all of them (shown in \autoref{fig:mainWindow4})

\begin{figure}[h]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Images/06MW.png}
	\caption{Main window with more than four diagrams open, more diagrams can be shown using the scroll bar}
	\label{fig:mainWindow4}
\end{figure}

Another activity the user will use frequently is the filtering system.
\\
In the previous section we took a look at the Main window and its different sections. There we described that filters that apply to every diagram are shown at all times shown as item 2. But what about when the user wants to create a filter that only affects one diagram?
\\
For that, the user would click on the Diagram filter (see previous section), an overlay would cover the whole window and a new set of containers, similar to the global filter, would appear, as seen on \autoref{fig:mainWindow6}
\\
On the top we see the global filter list, below it we see the filter list corresponding to the first diagram (diagram numbering is done left to right and top to bottom).
\\
In order to set a new filter that applies to only one diagram the user would open this screen, search for the corresponding diagram number and click on the "add filter button" at which point the button get's moved down to make space for a drop down menu containing all types of data from a data stream. The user selects one, and depending on which one, if appropriate, another drop down menu appears, with contextual relational symbols (i.e. less than (<), equals, etc.) and next to it a text box where the user can input the matching string to which to filter.

\subsubsection{Diagram types}
Next we'll discuss the four basic diagram types that comprise the minimum scope of this project and their possible use cases.
These are ~\autoref{fig:Diagram types}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[] \textbf{Line chart}: to easily compare, linearly, two variables from a data stream.
~\autoref{fig:Diagram types}(a)
	\item[]\textbf{Network Diagram}: provides a simple way to visualize the network topology. This diagram also gives the user the ability to inspect the nodes of the network and select data from a data point to be used as a filter in other diagrams (refer to last section for usage example).~\autoref{fig:Diagram types}(b)
	\item[]\textbf{Raster spike diagram}: this is useful to show the transmission window of each packet and it's corresponding partner.~\autoref{fig:Diagram types}(c)
	\item[]\textbf{Scatter plot}: a way to visualize up to 4 dimensions of the data stream.~\autoref{fig:Diagram types}(d)
\end{itemize}

These are examples and since the user has the ability to chose what part of the data stream is used for each axis it does not convey the full ability of these diagrams, that is left to the end user.

\subsubsection{Interactivity}

Visual analytics methods combine interactive visualisations with automated analysis
techniques. This allows the user to decide e.g. which part
of the data he or she wants to explore in more detail.

A basic principle for visual data exploration was introduced by Shneiderman (1997) by what he called the “The Visual Information Seeking Mantra:

Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand”.
This lets the data analyst define to a certain level what he or she wants
to analyze and visualise.

Similar to this, Bertin (1983) specified three “levels of reading,”:
The elementary level (allowing the analyst to look at the information about a
single data record), the intermediate level (showing summarised information about a group of data records), and the global level (providing an overview of all data elements).

\subsection{Object Modelling}

The diagram in \autoref{fig:adin-sys} shows a high-level view of the components of the ADIN-Inspector. The PSE group will develop the visualization component that runs in the web browser and a server side component called hub. The hub interfaces with the data sources and also implements the access control.

	\captionof{figure}{General system layout. Components to be developed by the PSE group are marked blue.}
	\label{fig:adin-sys}
\end{center}


\subsection{Dynamic Modelling}

The sequence diagram in \autoref{fig:adin-login-seq} shows the actions of the Hub component during login.
